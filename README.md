## Data Files

We have used the following dataset in our analysis: 

1. Sentinel-2 Water Edges Dataset (SWED) from [UK Hydrographic Office](https://openmldata.ukho.gov.uk/#:~:text=The%20Sentinel%2D2%20Water%20Edges,required%20for%20the%20segmentation%20mask.).

 The data is available under the Geospatial Commission Data Exploration license.

## Code Files
You can find the following files in the src folder:

- `SWED_exploration.ipynb` Initial analysis of SWED dataset with a focus on data quality
- `edge_detection.ipynb` Results of Canny, Sobel, Scharr and Prewitt edge detection algorithms applied to SWED. This file contains the code for all the figures in the conference paper.
